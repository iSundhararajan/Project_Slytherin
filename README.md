## Project: Slytherin House Analysis
### Team: Katherine Granados, Eros Reyes, Taisgaly Velez, Rayner Morla, Ishwarya Sundhararajan, Eduardo Silva

## Description
Team Slytherin had 2 hypotheses going into the project. The first hypothesis posited that more than 75% of Slytherin members were pure-blooded, a central theme in the Harry Potter series and one of the house's most prideful attributes. The second hypothesis suggested that less than 10% of Slytherin House consisted of non-human members. This README provides a detailed account of the analysis process and findings.


## Data
The analysis utilized three distinct Harry Potter datasets, each containing limited information regarding Slytherin members. Due to data constraints, preprocessing techniques such as the dropna() function were employed to eliminate rows lacking essential information. Consequently, the dataset was reduced to a sizeable yet limited sample.

## Analysis
Following data preprocessing, three tables were constructed and subsequently stored in a SQL database. Leveraging SQL querying capabilities, the data was manipulated to extract relevant insights and facilitate hypothesis testing.

## Results
The analysis validated both hypotheses. Findings revealed that a significant majority of Slytherin members were indeed pure-blooded and human, in alignment with the initial hypotheses.
